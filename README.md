### 3. **Cash Generation** (Free Cash Flow)
- *Example*: "Apple generates enough cash to buy Netflix... every year"
- Real money vs accounting profits analysis

### 4. **Valuation** (P/E Ratio)
- *Technical*: "P/E ratio of 31.2x"
- *Simplified*: "Like paying 31 years of rent upfront for a house"

## ü§ñ AI-Powered Features

### **Intelligent Insights Panel**
```
üéØ Hidden Opportunity: Services Monetization
While investors focus on iPhone sales, services revenue quietly became 22% 
of total revenue with 70% margins. Apple is successfully transitioning from 
hardware dependence to recurring revenue streams.

Evidence: ‚Ä¢ 8 quarters of double-digit growth ‚Ä¢ 1B+ paid subscribers
```

### **Dynamic Health Scoring**
- Adaptive weights based on:
  - Company maturity stage (growth vs mature)
  - Industry characteristics (tech vs utilities)
  - Economic environment (rising rates, inflation)
  - Business model (platform vs manufacturing)

### **Company Comparison**
```
üìä Apple vs Nvidia vs Uber

Profitability:  26.3%    73.0%    -8.2%
Growth:         4.9%     126.0%   15.8%
Cash Flow:      $99B     $28B     $2.1B

ü§ñ AI Analysis: "Apple dominates profitability and cash generation, 
Nvidia leads in growth and innovation premium, Uber shows operational 
leverage improving as platform scales."
```

### **Historical Pattern Recognition**
- 8-quarter trend analysis with AI-identified inflection points
- "Consistent margin expansion for 6 quarters until Q2 2024 when supply chain normalization reduced margins"
