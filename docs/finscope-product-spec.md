## Executive Summary

FinScope transforms complex SEC financial filings into accessible, visual stories that take 2-3 minutes to understand. We bridge the gap between oversimplified retail investing apps (Robinhood) and overwhelmingly complex professional tools (Bloomberg Terminal).

**Mission**: Make fundamental financial analysis accessible to retail investors without dumbing down the data.

**Vision**: Every retail investor can understand a company's financial health in under 3 minutes, with the depth and accuracy they need to make informed decisions.

**Broken User Journey**

3. Tries Yahoo Finance ‚Üí gets confusing tables of numbers
4. Attempts to read 10-K filing ‚Üí gives up after 50 pages
5. Makes investment decision without fundamental analysis
