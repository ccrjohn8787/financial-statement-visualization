   - **Mitigation**: âœ… Implemented comprehensive caching and background processing
   - **Status**: Mitigated

2. **Data Quality & Accuracy**
   - **Risk**: Financial data errors could impact investment decisions
   - **Mitigation**: âœ… Contract testing and validation at all layers
   - **Status**: Mitigated

3. **Frontend Complexity**
   - **Risk**: Financial charts and data visualization complexity
   - **Mitigation**: Use proven libraries (Recharts), start simple, iterate
   - **Status**: Being addressed

### Medium Priority Risks
