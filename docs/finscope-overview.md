## Quick Reference

### **Target User**
Informed retail investor (25-45, $75K-250K income) who wants to understand Apple's financial health before investing but finds current tools either too simple (Robinhood) or too complex (Bloomberg).

### **Core Value Proposition**
"Understand any company in 3 minutes" - Transform complex SEC filings into visual stories with plain English explanations, focusing on what actually matters for investment decisions.

### **MVP Scope** 
Three companies (Apple, Nvidia, Uber) with complete financial analysis including:
- Health score (A+ to F) with one-sentence summary
- 6 key metrics: Profitability, Growth, Cash Generation, Valuation, Debt/Equity, ROIC
- Both technical and plain English explanations for every number
- "What Changed" quarter-over-quarter analysis
- Web-responsive FinScope design with company selector

## Key Design Decisions

### **Data Strategy**
- **Primary Source**: Finnhub API for comprehensive financial data
- **Supplemental Source**: SEC EDGAR API for metrics not available in Finnhub
- **Update Frequency**: Real-time for stock prices, daily for financials
- **Demo Companies**: Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), Uber (UBER)

### **Visual Design**
- **Color Language**: Green (good), Yellow (caution), Red (concerning)
- **Typography**: Inter for text, JetBrains Mono for financial data
- **Layout**: Mobile-first with 4-column desktop grid
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Tooltips and hover states for education

### **Content Strategy**
- **Plain English**: Every metric explained in simple terms
- **Analogies**: "31 years of rent upfront" for P/E ratios
- **Context**: Always show vs industry and vs history
- **Education**: Hover tooltips with deeper explanations

---

## Implementation Phases

### **Phase 1: Foundation** (Week 1)
Enhance Finnhub integration to support 6 metrics across 3 companies. Add supplemental SEC data only where needed.

### **Phase 2: Intelligence** (Week 2)  
Implement 6-metric financial calculations, enhanced health scoring algorithm, and dual-mode content generation (technical + analogies).

### **Phase 3: Interface** (Week 3)
Build FinScope-style frontend with company selector, health score, 6 metric cards (3x2 grid), context box, and insights panel.

### **Phase 4: Polish** (Week 4)
Performance optimization, comprehensive testing, and demo preparation.

### **Phase 5: Launch** (Week 5)
Production deployment, monitoring setup, and launch execution.

## Review Questions for Stakeholders

### **Product Strategy**
1. Does the target user definition match your vision?
2. Is the "understand in 3 minutes" value proposition compelling?
3. Should we start with Apple or a different demo company?
4. Are the 4 key metrics (Profitability, Growth, Cash, Valuation) the right focus?

### **Design & UX**
1. Does the FinScope visual design match your expectations?
2. Is the health scoring approach (A+ to F grades) intuitive?
3. Are the plain English explanations helpful or too simple?
4. Should we include more or fewer metrics in the MVP?

### **Technical Approach**
1. Is the 5-week timeline realistic for your needs?
2. Should we prioritize additional companies or deeper Apple analysis?
3. Are the performance targets (2s load time) appropriate?
4. Should we plan for mobile app development immediately after?

### **Business Model**
1. Is the free MVP approach aligned with monetization plans?
2. Should we include user accounts/auth in the MVP?
